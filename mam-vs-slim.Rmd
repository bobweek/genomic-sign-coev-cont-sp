# classical coevolutionary models (reviewed in scotts book)

- mam

- gfg

- generalized mam/gfg

- multilocus

# slim

- effectively infinite sites model

- nucleotide model

# things

- an infinite sites model seems like it would lack equilibrium unless

  - there's a balance between rate of fixation and rate of mutation
